2- In the monoalphabetic substitution encryption, each alphabetic letter is substituted by another letter according to the following table:
|Plain text  | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  Cipher text| q | w | e | r | t | y | u | i | o | p | a | s | d | f | g | h | j | k | l | z | x | c | v | b | n | m |

## Solution
1. Constructing the table and storing it in the memory.
2. Writing a program to encrypt the input message
3. Decrypting the cipher text to obtain the original text message.
