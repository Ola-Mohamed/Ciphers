# Ciphers
This simple encryption program is made for the 8086 microprocessor.
there are two-way to encryption :
1- In the mono-numeric substitution encryption, each alphabetic letter is substituted by a
number according to the following table:

| Plain Text | Cipher Text | 
|--|--|
| a | 1 |
| b | 2 |
| c | 3 |
| d | 4 |
| e | 5 |
| f | 6 |
| g | 7 |
| h | 8 |
| i | 9 |
| j | 10 |
| k | 11 |
| l | 12 |
| m | 13 |
| n | 14 |
| o | 15 |
| p | 16 |
| q | 17 |
| r | 18 |
| s | 19 |
| t | 20 |
| u | 21 |
| v | 22 |
| w | 23 |
| x | 24 |
| y | 25 |
| z | 26 |

2- In the monoalphabetic substitution encryption, each alphabetic letter is substituted by another letter according to the following table:
|Plain text  | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  Cipher text| q | w | e | r | t | y | u | i | o | p | a | s | d | f | g | h | j | k | l | z | x | c | v | b | n | m |

## Solution
1. Constructing the table and storing it in the memory.
2. Writing a program to encrypt the input message
3. Decrypting the cipher text to obtain the original text message.
