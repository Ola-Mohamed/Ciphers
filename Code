; Storing letters from a to z (lower case)

MOV CX,26 ; Size of letters in the alphabet

MOV AL,61h ; ASCII code for letter 'a'

MOV DI,400h ; Hold the offset of memory location in the ES

CLD ; clears the direction flag ( DF = 0 )



store_letters:

STOSB ; Copies a byte from AL to a memory location in ES. DI is used to hold the offset of the memory location in the ES. After the copy, DI is automatically incremented or decremented to point to the next string element in memory.

INC AL ; Increases AL value by 1, therefore changing the letter

LOOP store_letters ; Loops if CX after decrementing by 1 not equal 0
